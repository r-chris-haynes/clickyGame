# Clicky Game 

This is a Garbage Pail Kids memory game, created with React.  The application's UI is a series of components. Component state is managed through props, and responds to user clicks.

# How it Works
* Score points by not selecting the same card twice 
* After a card is clicked the deck is randomly shuffled
* If a user outscores a previous game, then their score will become the new top score 
* If a card is chosen twice, then the game is over
