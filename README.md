# Garbage Pail Kids Clicky Game  
**A memory game created with React**
* Score points by not selecting the same card twice. 
* If a card is chosen twice,   then the game is over.  

# How it Works
* Score points by not selecting the same card twice 
* After a card is clicked the deck is randomly shuffled
* If a user outscores a previous game, then their score will become the new top score 
* If a card is chosen twice, then the game is over
